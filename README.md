# ScrollAnime

## Introduction

`ScrollAnime` is a library which is aimed to animate on scroll just like [`ScrollTrigger`](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/). Some name conventions would be different but the logic is pretty similar. 

I strongly recommend you to use that library because it is awesome and maintained. 

I donâ€™t know how exactly that library is implemented in the context of coding. I only have abstract ideas of that library and tried to create my own one based on those ideas.

> ðŸ’¡ The animation system of this library is solely dependent on [`animejs`](https://animejs.com/) library.

Most of usages are similar to [`ScrollTrigger`](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/) . Please have a look at the following examples.
